For my final project i would like to redesign the Mulan Restaurant website. The Mulan Restaurant is a Taiwanese restaurant my family and I frequent and we think their food is pretty authentic.  Their current website is pretty basic and it is obvious from the source they used a free website template and plugged in some stuff without tweaking much. The menu portion starts with two text links on a bright red background eye jarring background and the menus are basically jpg scans of the actual menu. I also want to remove the tables from the home pages and add some more to it- maps, etc. Interesting the old website (from when there was only one location in Cambridge) is actually still up and is the first search result rather than the new website. }
